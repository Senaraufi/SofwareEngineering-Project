# User Interface Testing

## Principle 1: Consistency

### Description
Consistency in UI design ensures that similar elements look and behave the same way throughout the application. This includes consistent navigation, color schemes, button styles, and terminology.

### Implementation
[Describe how consistency is implemented in your application]

### Test Case
1. Navigate to different pages in the application
2. Verify that navigation elements remain in the same position
3. Verify that button styles are consistent across pages
4. Verify that color schemes are consistent throughout the application

### Screenshots

## Principle 2: Feedback

### Description
Feedback informs users about the results of their actions and the current state of the system. Good feedback is immediate and clear.

### Implementation
[Describe how feedback is implemented in your application]

### Test Case
1. Submit a form with valid data and observe the success message
2. Submit a form with invalid data and observe the error messages
3. Perform an action that triggers a loading state and observe the loading indicator
4. Complete a multi-step process and observe the progress indicators

### Screenshots

## Principle 3: Recoverability

### Description
Recoverability allows users to recover from errors or undo actions they didn't intend to take. This principle helps users feel safe when using the application.

### Implementation
[Describe how recoverability is implemented in your application]

### Test Case
1. Intentionally trigger an error and observe the recovery options
2. Attempt to delete an item and verify the confirmation dialog
3. Navigate away from a form with unsaved changes and verify the warning message
4. Test the "undo" functionality if available

## Principle 4: Minimal User Clicks

### Description
Minimal user clicks ensures that users can accomplish their tasks with the fewest number of interactions possible, making the application more efficient to use.

### Implementation
[Describe how minimal user clicks is implemented in your application]

### Test Case
1. Measure the number of clicks required to complete a common task
2. Verify that shortcuts or quick actions are available for frequent tasks
3. Test that forms are designed efficiently with logical tab order
4. Verify that related actions are grouped together

### Screenshots

## Principle 5: Guidance

### Description
Guidance helps users understand how to use the application through clear instructions, tooltips, placeholders, and other helpful cues.

### Implementation
[Describe how guidance is implemented in your application]

### Test Case
1. Verify that forms have clear labels and placeholders
2. Check for tooltips on complex or unfamiliar elements
3. Test that error messages provide guidance on how to fix issues
4. Verify that empty states provide instructions on how to proceed
