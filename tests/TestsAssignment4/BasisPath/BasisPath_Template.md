# Basis Path Testing

## Method Under Test: User Authentication

### Description
This document outlines the basis path testing for the User Authentication method. Basis path testing is a white-box testing technique that uses the control flow graph of the code to identify a basis set of execution paths.

### Control Flow Graph

```
[1] Start
 |
 v
[2] Check if username/email exists
 |
 +---No---> [6] Return false (user not found)
 |
 v
[3] Check if password is correct
 |
 +---No---> [5] Return false (invalid password)
 |
 v
[4] Return user data
 |
 v
[7] End
```

### Cyclomatic Complexity Calculation

Cyclomatic Complexity = E - N + 2
- E (Edges) = 8
- N (Nodes) = 7
- Cyclomatic Complexity = 8 - 7 + 2 = 3

This means there are 3 independent paths through the code.

### Basis Paths

| Path ID | Path | Description | Expected Outcome |
|---------|------|-------------|------------------|
| Path 1 | 1-2-6-7 | User not found | Authentication fails, returns false |
| Path 2 | 1-2-3-5-7 | User found, password incorrect | Authentication fails, returns false |
| Path 3 | 1-2-3-4-7 | User found, password correct | Authentication succeeds, returns user data |

### Test Cases

| Test ID | Path | Test Data | Expected Outcome |
|---------|------|-----------|------------------|
| TC1 | Path 1 | Username: "nonexistent", Password: "anypassword" | Authentication fails |
| TC2 | Path 2 | Username: "existinguser", Password: "wrongpassword" | Authentication fails |
| TC3 | Path 3 | Username: "existinguser", Password: "correctpassword" | Authentication succeeds |

### Code Implementation

```php
public function authenticate($usernameOrEmail, $password)
{
    // [1] Start
    
    // [2] Check if username/email exists
    $user = $this->findByUsernameOrEmail($usernameOrEmail);
    
    if (!$user) {
        // [6] Return false (user not found)
        return false;
    }
    
    // [3] Check if password is correct
    if (!password_verify($password, $user->password)) {
        // [5] Return false (invalid password)
        return false;
    }
    
    // [4] Return user data
    $this->loadUserData($user);
    return true;
    
    // [7] End
}
```

### Conclusion

The basis path testing approach ensures that we test all independent execution paths through the authentication method. This provides confidence that all decision points and branches in the code are exercised and behave correctly.
